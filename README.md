# CodingNomads-Flask-2-Microframework
## Repository File Tree
This repository contains my work for the 2nd module in the [Coding Nomads Flask Web Framework](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-flask-web-framework) course. I completed this 21-module course as part of my independent learning, to invest in my Python skills. I produced an in-depth library of resources on this module, whose file tree is provided below.

## Library Contents
### Blue
I saved course material as a pdf file and made notes on this. I next made summary notes, by recording a voice memo of Siri reading my written notes out (Voiced Notes.mp4a). I then [created a word cloud](https://wordart.com/create) out of this (Word Cloud.png), to visually represent module content.
